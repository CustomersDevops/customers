# Customers
This repository is responsible for the "Customers" Squad for the NYU DevOps and Agile Methodologies Spring 2020 class project.
The customers resource is a representation of the customer accounts of the eCommerce site. At a minimum it will have the customerâ€™s first and last name along with some customer id that can be used as a key for uniquely identifying them. It may even have a userid and password. Customers also have at least one address.
